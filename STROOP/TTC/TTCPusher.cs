    /** A pusher is rectangular prism that extends from and
     *  retracts into the wall. They are referred to as
     *  "moving bars" in the star Timed Jumps on Moving Bars.
     *  
     *  A pusher beings flush with the wall (i.e. its outer surface
     *  is flush with the wall). It waits in this state for some
     *  amount of time, dictated by RNG. Then it retracts deeper
     *  into the wall, poised to eject, and waits in this state
     *  for some amount of time, dictated by RNG. Then it extends
     *  out, and calls RNG to determine whether it should extend out
     *  all the way out or stop flush with the wall. If it extends all
     *  the way out, then it eventually comes to a stop and then
     *  retracts until it's flush with the wall.
