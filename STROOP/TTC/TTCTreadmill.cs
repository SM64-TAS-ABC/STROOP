     *  in TTC, only the first one actually updates meaningfully
     *  using RNG, and the others simply copy what this
     *  first one is doing.
     *  
     *  When a treadmill comes to a stop, it calls RNG to determine
     *  whether it should move forwards or backwards and also
     *  how long it should move in that direction. Then the treadmill
     *  accelerates to 50 speed in that direction. Once it's moved
     *  in that direction for the allotted time, it decelerates to
     *  a stop, and the process repeats.
