    *  A bob-omb calls RNG every frame to determine whether
    *  it should blink its eyes. If it does blink, then it blinks
    *  for 16 frames, during which it won't call RNG.
    *  
    *  A bob-omb will only update when Mario is within 4000
    *  units of the bob-omb. Note that this is not synonymous
    *  with whether the bob-omb is visible or not, which is
    *  dictated by a radius smaller than 4000. In other words,
    *  for certain distances (like 3500), the bob-omb will
    *  not be visible, but will still update and call RNG
    *  just as normal.
