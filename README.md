## Status

## Building

Requirements:
  * Visual Studio *(2017 recommended)*
  * OpenTK 1.1 *(Version 1.1.1589.5942 used, others may work)*
  
Before building Stroop, OpenTK is a prerequisite. This is easiest installed by using the NuGet package manager. Stroop can be easily build from the source code by opening up the solution file in Visual Studio and performing a build.
