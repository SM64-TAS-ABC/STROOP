## Requirements

  As if the current build, Stroop has the following system requirements:
  * Windows 10 / Windows 8 / Windows 7 / Windows Vista 64-bit or 32-bit
  * .NET Framework 4.6 (See [.NET Framework System Requirements](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8z6watww(v=vs.110).aspx) for more information)
  * Mupen 0.5 (Other versions probably work)

## Downloading Stroop

The latest release of Stroop can be downloaded from our [Releases Page](https://github.com/SM64-STROOP/STROOP/releases). From here .zip files of recent builds can be found. The files can then be extracted and Stroop.exe can be opened.
  
## Building

Requirements:
  * Visual Studio *(2015 recommended)*
  * [OpenTK](https://opentk.github.io) *(Version 1.1 used, others may work)*
  
Before building Stroop, OpenTK is a prerequisite and must be installed beforehand. Stroop can be easily build from the source code by opening up the solution file in Visual Studio and performing a build.
