## Status 
  
  Stroop is currently under a development phase, however, pre-releases have been made. Current priorities include various new features and high-priority bug fixes. Prior Release 1.0, minor bug fixes will be addressed, and after code cleanlup will be focused on.
 
## Building

Requirements:
  * Visual Studio *(2015 recommended)*
  * OpenTK 1.1 *(Version 1.1.1589.5941 used, others may work)*
  
Before building Stroop, OpenTK is a prerequisite. This is easiest installed by using the NuGet package manager. Stroop can be easily build from the source code by opening up the solution file in Visual Studio and performing a build.
